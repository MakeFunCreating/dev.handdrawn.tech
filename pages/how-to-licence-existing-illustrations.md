#### Licensing Existing Illustrations

If you would like to use any of the illustrations listed in the illustration gallery, all you need is a licence, which you can get by contacting me via the chat fucntion.

As explained in <a href="/the-licence-model/">The Licence Model</a> section, when an artist creates an artwork, they automatically own the ‘copyright’ of that image and control the reproduction of the artwork. The artist can then sell a licence for that artwork – which means someone else has the right to reproduce it, in specific ways, for a specific amount of time. 


#### Calculating Fees

To calculate a licence fee I'll need some information about how you intend to use the illustration (again, covered in <a href="/the-licence-model/">The Licence Model</a> section). Once we have reached an agreement I'll draw up the licence, and on payment, share the hi-res illustration files with you.


#### File Formats

All the illustrations can be provided in multiple file formats, including layered PhotoShop files, that will allow you to alter the colours.
