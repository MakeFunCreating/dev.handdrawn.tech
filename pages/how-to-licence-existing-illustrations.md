#### The Licence Model


Whether you use one of my existing illustration, or commission a brand new illustration, you pay for a license and not the work itself. That's because when an artist creates an artwork, they automatically own the ‘copyright’ of that image and control the reproduction of the artwork.

The artist can then sell a licence for that artwork – which means someone else has the right to reproduce it, in specific ways, for a specific amount of time. A license can be ‘exclusive’ meaning no one else can use that image while your licence lasts. It can also be ‘non-exclusive’, meaning that anyone can licence the work from the artist at any given time.

For [new commissions](/how-to-commission-new-illustrations/), there is also an additional creation fee, this is normally a small percentage of the license fee costs.






#### License Fees


One of the benefits of the licensing model, is that you only pay for what you need, rather buying the illustration outright. So, for every license I'll need to know the following:


1. Territory: Which territory will the image be used in? E.g. UK / USA / Worldwide
2. Duration: How long will it be used for? E.g. 6 months / 1 year / 3 years / 5 years
3. Usage: What will it be used for? E.g. Billboards / newspaper / social media
4. Client: Who will be using it? E.g. A big multi-national / small business / newspaper


Once I have this information, I will try and provide a quote within a day or two.





#### Agreeing a Fee


If you know your budget, and are happy to share it, it will save a lot of time. There are lots of ways I can shape my quote to fit – e.g. limiting the licence, reducing the number of illustrations and amends, or by re-using elements.
