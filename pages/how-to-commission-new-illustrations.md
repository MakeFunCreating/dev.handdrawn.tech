#### New Commissions

For a new commission a written agreement will be required, this will include; a summary of the brief, the fee, the deadlines for the roughs and finished artworks, and the [licence](/how-to-licence-illustrations/) (where, how and for how long you will reproduce the work.



#### Creation & Delivery


Once terms have been agreed, I will submit roughs for your consideration, with upto three rounds of revisions (dependent on what we agreed) with further revisions charged at an agreed rate. When you’ve approved the roughs, I will then develop them into the finished artwork, after which, up to three further minor amends can be made.

There may be some cases where you have to reject the artwork. The following industry standard rejection/cancellation will then apply:

- 25% of the agreed fee if the work is rejected at rough stage.
- 33% – 50% of the agreed fee if the artwork is rejected on delivery
- 100% of the agreed fee if the commission is cancelled on the delivery of artwork.
