#### The Bad, But Unsurprising News

The copyright of all images displayed on handdrawn.tech belong to Scott Bedford. Using them without permission (other than fair use) is a breach of copyright.

#### The Good News

Luckily, all images can be legally licensed, here's a bit more about [how to license my illustrations](/how-to-licence-illustrations/).


#### The Even Better News

You are free to use my illustrations for design mock-ups:


1. You can use the images for the creation of concept designs and mock-ups to help you understand how handdrawn.tech illustrations look and feel within your project.
2. You can manipulate the images freely within image editing software (such as Photoshop) but cannot use the manipulated, or un-edited images for:
<em>(a)</em> A project, job or piece of work that is paid-for by a third-party.
<em>(b)</em> A project, job or piece of work that is publicly shown, in any form, or in any media, regardless of whether it has been paid for, or is free. The exception would be in order to present or pitch the design mock-ups internally, or to a client.
