If you’ve longed to build your kids a treehouse, but don’t have a tree, try converting your garden shed into an radical rooftop climbing frame instead. 

This monstrous 'shed conversion' was completed over two Summers, starting with the lower platform and trapdoor, and later the higher platform and climbing rope. That’s the beauty of this approach, by building a series of interconnected platforms, you can continue to add to the climbing frame over time.

What's more, it's also made from standard timber, nothing you couldn’t buy from the local hardware store, or fit in an average family size car.

So let's go on a tour, starting with the 'rope climb':


## How to make one

Below you'll find an exploded overview of my approach to construction, it is not all encompassing, but rather an inspiration and a guide.

<h3>1 | Start with a platform</h3>
<p>Make a simple wood frame and cover it with tongue and groove planks (marine plywood would be even easier). Add safety walls by attaching vertical posts, if you can't attach them securely connect them with horizontal beams for added strength. Next, add either wooden balusters or create a 'fence' from taught rope, see next steps for details. Finally, attach the platforms to the shed roof using long lengths of timber as support posts - use the exploded view above as a guide.</p>
<h3>2 | Safety Walls</h3>
<p>Drill two holes in each vertical post and prepare a number of wooden slats with two similarly distanced holes. Tie a knot at the end of two lengths of rope and feed them through the holes in the first post. Next, feed them through the holes in 2 or 3 wooden slats and then back throught the next post. Repeat until the rope lengths have been fed through the last post. Pull the rope taught and secure with further knots. Space the slats evenly and fix them in position with screws, see illustration 2.</p>
<h3>3 | Even Safer walls!</h3>
<p>If you have connected the posts with a horizontal beam, it might be easier, and more secure, to simply screw on wooden balusters along each side, see illustration 3.</p>
<h3>Tip</h3>
<p>Secure the platform support posts in the ground using spikes made from straightened angle bracket. This will stop them slipping or moving.</p>
<h3>4 | Trapdoor</h3>
<p>Cut a hole in the roof felt (A). Drill 4 holes and use a jig-saw to cut out a square hole (B). Make a wooden frame and screw it onto the roof (obviously it will need to be slightly bigger than the hole). Let the felt overlap the edges of the frame an use roof bitumen to seal it (C). Make another wooden frame big enough to fit over the first. Cover it with wood and felt. Attach it to the first frame using hinges (D).</p>
<h3>5 | Add a crane</h3>
<p>Accesorize your climbing frame with a ‘friction grip’ crane, it uses a simple notch to grip the rope. Please note, you will need to buy one small pulley and two door hinges from your local hardware store. Just follow the illustration.</p>
<h3>6 | Ladder up</h3>
<p>Make a simple ladder and attach it to the inside of the shed, directly under the trapdoor, you'll never be able to climb up onto the platform without it!</p>

## Do your own thing

It’s unlikely you’ll have the same shed, or garden space as me, so make use of your own unique situation, get creative, and have fun coming up with your own crazy rooftop climbing frame experience!
