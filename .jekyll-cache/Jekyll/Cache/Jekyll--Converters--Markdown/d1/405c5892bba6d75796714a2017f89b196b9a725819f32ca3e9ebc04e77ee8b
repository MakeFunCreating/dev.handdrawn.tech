<h4>The Licence Model</h4>

<p>Whether you use one of my existing illustration, or commission a brand new illustration, you pay for a license and not the work itself. Thatâ€™s because when an artist creates an artwork, they automatically own the â€˜copyrightâ€™ of that image and control the reproduction of the artwork.</p>

<p>The artist can then sell a licence for that artwork â€“ which means someone else has the right to reproduce it, in specific ways, for a specific amount of time. A license can be â€˜exclusiveâ€™ meaning no one else can use that image while your licence lasts. It can also be â€˜non-exclusiveâ€™, meaning that anyone can licence the work from the artist at any given time.</p>

<p>For <a href="/how-to-commission-new-illustrations/">new commissions</a>, there is also an additional creation fee, this is normally a small percentage of the license fee costs.</p>

<h4>License Fees</h4>

<p>One of the benefits of the licensing model, is that you only pay for what you need, rather buying the illustration outright. So, for every license Iâ€™ll need to know the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Territory: Which territory will the image be used in? E.g. UK / USA / Worldwide</li>
  <li>Duration: How long will it be used for? E.g. 6 months / 1 year / 3 years / 5 years</li>
  <li>Usage: What will it be used for? E.g. Billboards / newspaper / social media</li>
  <li>Client: Who will be using it? E.g. A big multi-national / small business / newspaper</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I have this information, I will try and provide a quote within a day or two.</p>

<h4>Agreeing a Fee</h4>

<p>If you know your budget, and are happy to share it, it will save a lot of time. There are lots of ways I can shape my quote to fit â€“ e.g. limiting the licence, reducing the number of illustrations and amends, or by re-using elements.</p>
