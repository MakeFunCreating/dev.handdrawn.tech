<h4>New Commissions</h4>

<p>For a new commission a written agreement will be required, this will include; a summary of the brief, the fee, the deadlines for the roughs and finished artworks, and the <a href="/how-to-licence-illustrations/">licence</a> (where, how and for how long you will reproduce the work.</p>

<h4>Creation &amp; Delivery</h4>

<p>Once terms have been agreed, I will submit roughs for your consideration, with upto three rounds of revisions (dependent on what we agreed) with further revisions charged at an agreed rate. When youâ€™ve approved the roughs, I will then develop them into the finished artwork, after which, up to three further minor amends can be made.</p>

<p>There may be some cases where you have to reject the artwork. The following industry standard rejection/cancellation will then apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>25% of the agreed fee if the work is rejected at rough stage.</li>
  <li>33% â€“ 50% of the agreed fee if the artwork is rejected on delivery</li>
  <li>100% of the agreed fee if the commission is cancelled on the delivery of artwork.</li>
</ul>
