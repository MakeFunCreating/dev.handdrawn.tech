<h4>Commissioning New Illustrations</h4>

<p>As new commission, is a bespoke illustration created on request. For a new commission a written agreement will be required, this will include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A summary of the brief</li>
  <li>The fee</li>
  <li>The deadlines for the roughs and finished artworks</li>
  <li>The <a href="/the-licence-model/">licence</a> (where, how and for how long you will reproduce the work)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Creation &amp; Delivery</h4>

<p>Once terms have been agreed, I will submit roughs for your consideration, with upto three rounds of revisions (dependent on what we agreed) with further revisions charged at an agreed rate. When youâ€™ve approved the roughs, I will then develop them into the finished artwork, after which, up to three further minor amends can be made.</p>

<p>There may be some cases where you have to reject the artwork. The following industry standard rejection/cancellation will then apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>25% of the agreed fee if the work is rejected at rough stage</li>
  <li>33% â€“ 50% of the agreed fee if the artwork is rejected on delivery</li>
  <li>100% of the agreed fee if the commission is cancelled on the delivery of artwork</li>
</ul>

<h4>Calculating Fees</h4>

<p>To understand how fees are calculated, I suggest reading <a href="/the-licence-model/">The Licence Model</a> section. For new commissions there is also an additional creation fee, this is normally a percentage of the licence fee costs. If you would like to discuss a new commission and get a quote, please start by contacting me via the chat fucntion.</p>
