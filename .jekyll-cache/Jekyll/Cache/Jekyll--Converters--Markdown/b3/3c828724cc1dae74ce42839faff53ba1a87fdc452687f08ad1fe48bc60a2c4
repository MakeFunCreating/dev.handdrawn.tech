<h4>Licensing Existing Illustrations</h4>

<p>If you would like to use any of the illustrations listed in the illustration gallery, all you need is a licence, which you can get by contacting me via the chat fucntion.</p>

<p>As explained in <a href="/the-licence-model/">The Licence Model</a> section, when an artist creates an artwork, they automatically own the â€˜copyrightâ€™ of that image and control the reproduction of the artwork. The artist can then sell a licence for that artwork â€“ which means someone else has the right to reproduce it, in specific ways, for a specific amount of time.</p>

<h4>Calculating Fees</h4>

<p>To calculate a licence fee Iâ€™ll need some information about how you intend to use the illustration (again, covered in <a href="/the-licence-model/">The Licence Model</a> section). Once we have reached an agreement Iâ€™ll draw up the licence, and on payment, share the hi-res illustration files with you.</p>

<h4>File Formats</h4>

<p>All the illustrations can be provided in multiple file formats, including layered PhotoShop files, that will allow you to alter the colours.</p>
