#### General
{: #target-1}


##### Non-exclusivity

All Items are non-exclusive. This means that you are not the only person with access to the Item, others will also be licensing and using the same Item. Items purchased via the on-demand (freelance) service, are also non-exclusive, unless you negotiate exclusive terms prior.


##### License updates

The license that applied when you purchased the will remain applicable, independent of future updates. Also, your license continues even if an Item is removed from Make Fun Creating.



##### Terms of use for freelancers and agencies

You are permitted to use an Item for work you are doing for a client. Essentially you are buying the file on your client's behalf. If the Item is an Illustration, your client's use of the end product will determine whether a Regular or Extended License is needed.

Once you transfer the end product to the client (e.g. giving them source files for the Item), be sure to link your client to our licenses and delete the Item itself from your computer.

*Example:* If you design a presentation for a client using a presentation template, you could give them the template as long as you deleted it and linked your client to our license.



##### Transferring a license 

You can only transfer a license in the following intances:

* A freelancer or agency using the Item for client work. The license would in effect be transferred to the client on completion of the work (see previous section).
* The Item is part of an on-demand "create-your-own" service where you purchase a separate license on behalf of the customer for each individual end product they make. Each license would in effect be transferred to the customer.
* The Item (license) is purchased by a 3rd party for use as a prize / giveaway, the license would in effect be transferred to the recipient of the giveaway.

*N.B.* in all of these cases, be sure to point the client / customer / recipient to the license terms and delete the Item from your own systems.



##### Logo or branding usage

Fonts and Illustrations can't be used in logos or branding. None of our Items can be trademarked.

#### Trademarks and models
{: #target-6}



##### Recognisable real-word products and trademarks

Recognisable real-word products or trademarks, in most instances, will not be property released. This means if an Item contains a real-world product or trademark (or any other real object or building), the original owner of copyright, trademark or other rights in that real-world thing may not have cleared the Item.

So if you want to use the Item for your project, youâ€™ll need to consider how you'll be using the Item. If it's for a non-editorial purpose you'll need to get clearance from the original rights owner (editorial use means using an Item only for news or journalistic purposes like in blogs, magazine and newspaper editorial applications).

*For example:* An illustration of an 'Apple Mac Laptop computer'. The Apple Mac Laptop computer is a real-world product which Make Fun Creating did not create. Although Make Fun Creating created and owns the illustration, they don't own any intellectual property rights in the real Apple Mac Laptop computer itself, Apple does. So it's OK to use the illustration for editorial purposes but if you want to use that illustration for other purposes, you'll need to contact Apple to get permission.

If you're not sure whether you need permission for your particular use, you can look at the product owner's brand use or product use guidelines, or contact the product owner directly. If this is something you're not able to do, another Item containing a generic product or a product of the author's own creation might suit your needs.




##### Use of Illustrations with people/models

Illustrations of people are based on photographs from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/license). Even though these photographs are model released, photos with images of people can't be used in a way that implies the model is personally endorsing something. They also cannot be used for sensitive subjects. Sensitive subjects are those that could be offensive or highly unflattering to the model or put them in a bad light (using a reasonable standard), such as medical and health issues, sexual activity, pornography (adult content), substance abuse, tobacco use, or immoral or illegal activity. This is not an exhaustive list so if you're not sure, contact us.
