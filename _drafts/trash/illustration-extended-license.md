#### 1. Overview
{: #target-1 }

*1.1.* The Illustration Extended License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, commercial, worldwide license to make use of the digital image (Illustration) you have selected, on the following terms. The [General Terms of Use License](/pro-draw/general-terms-of-use-license) form part of this license.

*1.2.* You are licensed to use the Illustration in the following ways (Allowed Uses):

(a) to create multiple End Products that incorporate the Illustration as well as other things, so that each End Product is larger in scope and different in nature than the Illustration; and
(b) to communicate to the public (perform), broadcast, display, distribute, and reproduce those End Products in any and all media and for all uses, subject to the terms and restrictions in this license.
Examples of End Products: publications, signage, packaging, websites, games, apps, presentations, online videos, films, TV shows and advertisements, posters, t-shirts and other merchandise.

#### 2. What you can do with the Illustration
{: #target-2 }

*2.1.* You can create one or more End Products for yourself, your employer, or a client. If you create an End Product for a client, then the client is granted a Limited Sublicense to the Illustration as part of the End Product and only for use in that specific End Product. So the Illustration itself must not be extracted, reproduced, or used in any other way. You must inform your client of this condition and they must also agree to these terms.

*2.2.* You can make unlimited copies of End Products. You can distribute End Products through multiple media, and you can make them available online or broadcast them to an unlimited number of viewers.

*2.3.* You can modify or manipulate the Illustration, or combine the Illustration with other works, to suit each End Product. The resulting works based on the Illustration are subject to the terms of this license. You cannot claim ownership to the Illustration, whether it’s in original form or altered under this clause. You can do the things allowed in this clause as long as each End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 1.2.

*Examples:* you can edit, composite or stylize an Illustration to suit your project. See clause 4.6 for more information about ownership rights in the Illustration.

*2.4.* You and multiple other people within your organization may have access to the Illustration for the purpose granted by this license. Access should only be given to the people working on the End Product(s) incorporating this Illustration.

*2.5.* You can use the Illustration for merchandising, which means an End Product where the primary value of the product lies in the Illustration itself. While merchandising use is allowed you still can’t use the Illustration in stock templates or on-demand applications as per Clauses 3.2 and 3.3.

For example you can use the photo on a mug, poster, t-shirt, or other merchandising product you sell copies of. However, you still can’t allow multiple end users to customize and print their own merchandise using the photo via an online service, or sell copies of the photo as part of a stock Illustration or template.

#### 3. What you can can’t do with the Illustration
{: #target-3 }

*3.1.* While you may create End Products using the Illustration for multiple different clients, you must not allow your clients to extract, repurpose, or reuse the Illustration in any other way. If your clients wish to make full use of the original Illustration themselves and use it within their own separate End Products, they will need to purchase their own license.

*For example:* You can use the illustration to create customized flyers for different clients, but your clients can’t then reuse the original photo to create their own flyers in the future, without obtaining their own individual license for the photo (e.g. by purchasing it themselves, or you purchasing one on their behalf).

*3.2.* You can’t re-distribute the Illustration as a photo, as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Illustration either on its own or bundled with other Illustrations, even if you modify the Illustration. You can’t re-distribute the Illustration as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for free.

*For example:* You can’t license an illustration and then re-distribute it as a digital wallpaper or as an image in a stock website template for resale.

*3.3.* You can’t use the Illustration in any application allowing an end user to customize a digital or physical product to their specific needs, such as an “on demand”, “made to order” or “build it yourself” application. You can use the Illustration in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product incorporating the Illustration that is created using the application. The multi-use nature of this license is not intended for this type of “on demand” use.

Examples of “on demand”, “made to order” or “build it yourself” applications: online custom apparel or product printing services, “create your own” slideshow apps, and e-card generators. You will need one license for each product created by a customer, or contact us to discuss.

*3.4.* You must not permit an end user to extract the Illustration and use it separately from the End Product.

*3.5.* You can’t claim trademark or service mark rights over the Illustration within the End Product.

#### 4. Other license terms
{: #target-4 }

*4.1.* You can only use Illustrations for lawful purposes. Also, you can’t use Illustrations in connection with defamatory, obscene or demeaning material, or in connection with sensitive subjects.

For more information on sensitive subjects, see the [General Terms of Use License](/pro-draw/general-terms-of-use-license).

*4.2.* Even if the the Illustrations are model-released, you can’t use them in a way that creates a fake identity, or implied personal endorsement of a product by the person.

For more information about model and property releases, see the [General Terms of Use License](/pro-draw/general-terms-of-use-license).

*4.3.* You must not use Illustrations in violation of any export laws that apply to you.

*4.4.* This license applies in conjunction with the Make Fun Creating Terms. If there is an inconsistency between this license and the Make Fun Creating Terms, this license will apply to the extent necessary to resolve the inconsistency.

*4.5.* This license can be terminated if you breach it and don’t remedy the breach. If termination happens, you must stop using the Illustration, which includes no longer making copies of or distributing the End Products until you remove the Illustration from them. This license can also be terminated for only the End Products to which a breach relates (rather than all End Products). In this case, this clause applies only to those End Products.

*4.6.* The author of the Illustrations (Make Fun Creating) retains ownership of the Illustrations but grants you the license on these terms. You can’t claim ownership of the Illustration, even if modified under clause 2.3, for example through content identification systems.

*4.7.* This license is between the author (Make Fun Creating) of the Illustration and you.
