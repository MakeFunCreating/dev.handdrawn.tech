"Made by Dad" is chock full of 67 extraordinary, custom-designed how-to projects for DIY parents everywhere. The projects range from full-length, artfully illustrated creations to smaller, MacGyver-like challenges that can be whipped out at the coffee shop, plus "DIY Dad" tips sprinkled throughout and illustration templates to boost your project's artistic appeal. 

All chapters, categorized by theme - Dangerous Decor, Gross Gadgets, Covert Creations, Crafty Disasters, Home Hacks, and more - include step-by-step project illustrations, complete with visual "status checks" (to help you keep up), and clever, playful games to incorporate the finished project.

Dads will love to create stealthy contraptions like the Bunk Bed Communicator, and the whole family will be impressed with the endless entertainment that can be gleaned from the "Steampunk"-Inspired Balancing Robot.

While the projects have a decidedly mad-scientist-in-his-laboratory feel, the book's charm and richness of material will appeal to mummies, too-especially when she flips to the whole chapter of projects dedicated to showing Mum-appreciation - like the I Love You THIS MUCH Pop-up Card (with Go-Go-Gadget-style arms that extend to give Mum a virtual hug!).
