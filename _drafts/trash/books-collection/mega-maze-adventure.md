The world's longest maze in a book! A-MAZE-ING. Not just a maze--the book itself is a maze! A portal opens on the front cover, and the maze continues through every page, making this the world's longest maze in a book. Every spread is a journey through an imaginative world: there's Robot World and Butterfly World, Ski World and Underwater World, Dragon World and Skyscraper World. Filled with hypnotic details, hidden surprises, fun facts, and bright, swirling, richly-colored details, every page is a compelling adventure.

##### What People Say

<!-- DIVIDER  -->

"This maze book is the best I've seen. I got it for my 7-year-old from a local toy shop and then bought another here for my 5-year-old. They're both enjoying them... And they're taking quite some time to complete them. The mazes are difficult but not too difficult, and there is interesting information and extra things to find on each page. Even appeals to adults as I would like to do it as well! Love it!""
