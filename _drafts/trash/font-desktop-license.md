#### 1. Overview
{: #target-1 }

*1.* This license grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to make use of the digital Font you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Font, as well as the [General Terms of Use License](/pro-draw/licenses/general-terms-of-use-license) (which form part of this license).

*2.* This license is for one copy (one seat, or one usage at any one time) of the Font, installed on up to 2 of your computers.

#### 2. What you can do with the Font
{: #target-2 }

*1.* You can use a Font to create an unlimited number of different End Products. Using a Font is conditional upon there only ever being one concurrent use of the item by you, the original purchaser.

*2.* You can sell End Products created using a Font, to any number of people, as long as the font letters are not the main selling point. As explained further on, the End Products must not contain the Font itself.

#### 3. What you can’t do with the Font
{: #target-3 }

*1.* You can’t re-distribute, modify or make derivatives of a Font.

*For example:* After licensing a font you can’t give the font files to a client or a friend.
The Font is licensed to you ‘as is’ and is a complete item that cannot be modified.

*2.* You can’t incorporate or distribute the Font with an End Product. But you may link the users of the End Product to where they can directly license the Font.

*For example:* You license a font and use it in a flyer template (see below for a definition of a template). You can’t include the font in the flyer template download, but you can link buyers of the template to the font.

*3.* You can't embed a font in a document, with the exception of PDF files, 

*3.* You can't place the font on a server and use it as a web font.

*1.* This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop using the Font and delete it from your computers.

*2.* The author of the Font, Make Fun Creating, retains ownership of the item but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between Make Fun Creating and you.
